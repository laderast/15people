Welcome to the new website. I apologize for not updating the blogs with any text posts, but I have been having a really terrible relationship with the Tumblr version of this site. It's annoying, hard to update, and frankly slow-loading.

I've moved the website over to Hugo and hosting it on netlify, which frankly works much better than Tumblr. I'm not importing the Tumblr photos. I will probably clear out that theme but leave those photos up on Tumblr.
