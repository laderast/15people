It's been a while since I've done a proper release. I've also been feeling pretty powerless since the coronavirus is devastating so many people, not only physically but economically.

I composed the *Quiescent* EP (a fancy word for sleeping) to help me sleep, and I hope it can help you sleep as well.

The album is free to download, but donations are encouraged. I'll donate all proceeds to the Oregon Food Bank. I'll also match donations up to $200 total.

The *Quiescent* EP can be found here: https://ooray.bandcamp.com/album/quiescent

Thanks to everyone who has donated so far!
