I know it has been ages since I updated the website. The last post I have is during COVID. I really didn't have much to announce.

My new album [*Marginals* is being released August 15 on Beacon Sound](https://beaconsound.bandcamp.com/album/marginals-2) on Cassette and on Digital. We'll be having a release party at Dream House starting at 8 PM till about 10 PM. Copies will be available to purchase.

Special guests include Derek Hunter Wilson (live piano), Amulets, and Patricia Wolf (DJing). 

Sliding scale $10 - $20 - all proceeds will be donated to [Undocu PDX](https://www.undocupdx.com/). 

Hope to see you there!
