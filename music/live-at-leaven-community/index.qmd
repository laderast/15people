Honestly, this live set is one of the best ones I've ever recorded. I'm releasing it to raise money for It gets better (to show LGBTIQ+ teens that we care about them) and Islamic Relief USA.

Recorded Live at Leaven Community 5/31/2024. Improvised using OP1, Dvina, Thumb Piano, Microcosm, Mood, Norns Concrete.

Thanks to Tim, Marc, Christi, Francisco, and everyone who attended. You all made it an awesome show.
