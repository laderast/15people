<blockquote>
<p>Marcus Fischer + The OO-Ray have deftly assembled in their collaborative improvisational work both a cohesive sonic realism, and impressionistic vision with a timeless authenticity.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using cello, lap harp, tuning forks, synthesizers, guitar, and percussion as sound sources and analog and digital processing as production means, the two first generated long-form improvisations and then shaped them into the album&rsquo;s seven settings. In their final form, however, the pieces unfold in a patient and natural manner that makes them seem more like meditative drones delicately shaped in real-time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A few days ago in the evening in Warsaw, I was walking the street late at night and I could hear the sound of crickets. It would not be strange if it were not quite cold for a few days earlier. Someone said, ‘Because in a war at this venue was the ghetto’. I thought: &lsquo;Tessellations’ moves things important, but fortunately only comes close to the border of pathos.</p>
