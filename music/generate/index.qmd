For the last three years, I've been struggling with writer's block and perfectionism. Nothing I made seemed worth releasing. The songs from *Generate* resulted from trying to escape this perfectionism. I started working with generative music processes as a way to give up control. I used simple rules of harmonic modulation with random processes to mutate simple musical ideas into surprising pieces. In other words, I used the generative processes to expand my concepts of ambient music and go in new directions.

The result is an expansion of my musical ideas into longer form pieces. *Generate* is the start of a brand-new musical journey, and I'm excited about the new possibilities. I'm extremely excited about the 13-minute piece, *Undo*, that is both minimal and lush. I no longer feel trapped by perfectionism and I'm excited for the future.

I used Eurorack, Cello, Granular Synths, and other instrumentation to make these songs. All pieces were recorded as a single take with minimal overdubs. I hope you enjoy this album as much as I did whilst making it.
