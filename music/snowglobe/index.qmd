The OO-Ray is back with a holiday gift for everyone. Utilizing new skills in orchestration, the Snowglobe EP presents three miniatures dedicated to the frost, calm, and peace of the winter season. Piano and harp supplement these gentle, joyous, electroacoustic pieces.

Please download, share, and enjoy with everyone this holiday season! My best to everyone who's been kind and generous enough to support me and my music this past year.
